### Bugs and Issues
Do not use GitHub issues to report bugs! Use the [BGA Bug Tracker](https://boardgamearena.com/bugs?game=2567) instead.

### Art files

This repository does not contain the game's artfiles used for the adaptation.

### Support

With [Synapses Games](https://www.jeuxsynapsesgames.com/) we decided to make the game free to play for every [Board Game Arena](https://boardgamearena.com/) user, without any limitations.

You can support the designers by purchasing a physical copy of the game, or the developer of the digital version on [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/abeltibortoth).

Thank you!
